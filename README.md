## Description 
Using a RESTful API and starting code, a fully functional Google Books API search engine was created for this project. I've redesigned it to be an Apollo Server-built GraphQL API. With a MongoDB database, Node.js/Express.js server, React front end, and API, the application was developed with the MERN stack. 

## User Story

```md
AS AN avid reader
I WANT to search for new books to read
SO THAT I can keep a list of books to purchase
```

## Live-URL

[Deployed Page with Heroku]()

## Installation 

* Start server with command `npm run dev`.



## Features

One of the site's features is React's ease of use in creating one-page applications that look like multi-page ones. The site is simple to use, and users can save or remove books from their profile as well as search books using the embedded GoogleAPI.
